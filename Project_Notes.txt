LAST THING I WORKED ON

	- work on the login system - created a userlogin model

What to do next:



 	- work on the account section 
 
 	- create a league and enter teams

 	- once I can create a league and enter teams, work on the fixture generation

 	- scoring submissions

 

TO DO:

account.php 
 - account details entered into the login system
 

league.php
 - create a league creation form
  - name
  - type
   - singles / doubles
  - format - knockout / round robin
  - enter competitors
   - email competitors to get them to confirm their entry "you have been invited, click to register"
 - view league (dashboard) - completed the code to display, needs tied in with users
  - enter league name to view

fixtures.php
 - create fixture list

register.php
 - create a register form
  - name email



when viewing league
 - list teams by player id

 A PLAYER IS A TEAM!!!!



build league creation form

Build login system

create the template system (require the correct pages)

build the fixture list generation functions ( formats - knockout, round robin, both )

build the score submission system



GENERAL 

create user for database


DONE

create a database class to connect, get, insert, update and delete data in a OOP methodology 
 - done (need to test update and delete when building account page?)

created the base pages

separated the header and footer into includes

create a directory section in my main httpd.conf file instead of using .htaccess files in public and app directories

create the mvc structure to allow for URL routing, this will enable me to separate my code into models, views and controllers.

separate code into MVC structure (routing is the main issue here)
